# In this repository
can be found:
 - `homework.pdf` contains the assigned questions
 - `Gauss-Seidel.m` contains the code to run Gauss-Seidel on the input matrix to solve Problem C.b. It currently doesn't converge to the solution to Problem C.b for reasons unknown.
 - `setup.m' creates a matrix of a given size for use in solving Problem C.b
 - `maxError.m` calculates the max error of two matrices.
 - `exact.m` calculates the exact solution according to Piazza post 23
 - `maxExactError.m` calculates the max error of the input matrix as compared to the exact solution.
 - `Question_c.m` is a script and contains code that answers question C.b.

All .m files containing functions (all except those I noted specifically as scripts) have comments describing their use. Or, they will by the deadline of the assignment.
